## Challenge Objective

The Cable Co is missing customers from their customer relationship management system. Download the missing customers CSV (found on the challenge page itself), loop through each customer's details to enter the customer into the web form. Once all customer's details have been added, the challenge is complete and your results will be displayed. These results are displayed as a measure of time taken to complete the challenge as well as the accuracy of the data entered.

## Rules
 
Beyond completing the challenge with 100% accuracy (which is obviously the core objective), the only rule for this week's challenge is that your bot has to download the file as a part of its execution.


## Conclusion
 
Have fun with this challenge. If you complete it the first way you think to do it, go back through and think through how you might be able to use different actions to speed up your processing time. If you tried it and are getting stuck, don't worry, we'll be back on Thursday with a challenge page tutorial session where we'll be doing a full bot build to demonstrate one of the ways to solve this challenge.
